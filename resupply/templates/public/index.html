				<h2>
					Super Smart
				</h2>
				<p>
				At Resupply we bring a smart solution to lifes inconveniences.
				We studied how much each person uses consumer products
				like Toothpaste, Dishwasher Soap and Laundry Detergent as well as
				what dentists recommend when it comes to toothbrushes and floss.
				<br>Resupply uses this data to send what you need as you need it.
				The best part: You don't even have to tell us when you run out!

				<!--At Resupply we realized that many Americans had no idea how much they 
				were actually spending on home products. How many loads of laundry they 
				were doing, how many dish washer cycles were being run. We decided to 
				figure it out and build a company dedicated to giving you smart solutions 
				to lifes inconveniences.-->
